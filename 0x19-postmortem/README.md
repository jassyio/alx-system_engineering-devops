Postmortem: Web Stack Outage
Issue Summary
Duration:
Start Time: January 19, 2024, 08:30 AM UTC
End Time: January 19, 2024, 11:45 AM UTC

Impact:
The outage affected our main web application, causing a 30% increase in latency and intermittent unavailability for users across all regions.

Timeline
8:30 AM: Issue detected through automated monitoring alerts indicating elevated response times.
8:35 AM: Engineering team initiated investigation into server logs and application metrics.
9:00 AM: Assumed the issue to be a database bottleneck due to sudden traffic spikes.
9:30 AM: Escalated incident to database and networking teams for further analysis.
10:00 AM: Database team identified slow queries but couldn't find a clear root cause.
10:30 AM: Investigated potential DDoS attack, leading to unnecessary deployment of DDoS mitigation measures.
11:00 AM: Realized the issue was misdiagnosed; actual root cause identified as a misconfigured load balancer.
11:30 AM: Incident escalated to infrastructure team for load balancer reconfiguration.
11:45 AM: Issue resolved, and services restored to normal operation.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:
The misconfigured load balancer was directing traffic unevenly, causing a bottleneck in one of the application servers. This led to increased latency and occasional unavailability.

Resolution:
The load balancer was reconfigured to evenly distribute traffic among all application servers. Additionally, automated checks were implemented to detect and alert on load balancer misconfigurations in real-time.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements/Fixes:

Load Balancer Monitoring: Enhance monitoring to proactively detect load balancer misconfigurations.
Database Optimization: Continue optimizing database queries to prevent performance bottlenecks.
DDoS Mitigation Plan: Review and refine the DDoS mitigation plan to avoid unnecessary measures during incidents.
Tasks:

Load Balancer Configuration Audit: Conduct a thorough audit of load balancer configurations to identify and fix potential misconfigurations.
Automated Load Balancer Checks: Implement automated checks to ensure load balancer configurations align with best practices.
Documentation Update: Update documentation to include clear guidelines on load balancer configuration and troubleshooting.
Team Training: Provide training sessions for the engineering and operations teams on recognizing and resolving load balancer-related issues.
Post-Incident Review: Conduct a post-incident review with all involved teams to analyze the incident handling process and identify areas for improvement.
By implementing these measures, we aim to enhance our system's reliability, reduce response times during incidents, and prevent similar issues in the future. We appreciate your patience and understanding during this outage, and we remain committed to delivering a seamless user experience.
